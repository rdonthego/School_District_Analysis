**Overview of the School District Analysis**

After becoming aware of the possibility of academic dishonesty for reading and math scores within the Thomas High School 9th grade class.  To uphold state-testing standards the district requested pulling out the 9th graders math and reading scores and rerunning the School District Analylsis.

**Results**

1. How was the district summary affected?

The original data analysis shows as follows:

The data suggests that there was a slight decrease of average math scores from 79% to 78.9%.  The average reading score remained the same.  Similarly there was a slight decrease in the percentage of passing students for math, reading, and overall passing.  Data was affected negatively by .2% or less. The school district summary was basically unchanged.

2. How ws the school summary affected?

Due to the THS passing scores and math scores improvement, the district increased slightly.

The school's passing rate increased by about 10% placing them at the top of the district for all scores.

7.  How did replacing the 9th grade scores affect:
  a. math and reading scores by grade
    **Math Score Comparison**
    The following output from the math scores by grade removing the THS 9th grader data was as follows:

There was no change in per grade passing except for the 9th graders of Thomas High School received no scores.

    **Reading Score Comparison**
    
    Likewise the output after the 9th grade scores were removed:

    There was no change in scores except that the passing rate again was 0% due to the scores' removal.
    
  b. Scores by school spending
  The first image of code is from the original data set:

The original data on school size compared to scores:

The data suggests that larger school campuses are associated with lower math, reading, and overall passing scores.

  d. Scores by school type
  
  Following are the data frames from before the scores were removed for the 9th graders and after:
